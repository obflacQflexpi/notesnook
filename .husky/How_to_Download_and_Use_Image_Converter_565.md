# How to Download and Use Image Converter 565
 
Image Converter 565 is a tool that can convert images into the formats required for UTFT libraries for Arduino and chipKit. UTFT is a library that allows you to use TFT LCD modules with Arduino and chipKit boards. Image Converter 565 can convert images to .c or .raw files that can be used with UTFT functions.

In this article, we will show you how to download and use Image Converter 565 to convert your images for UTFT projects.
 
## Step 1: Download Image Converter 565
 
Image Converter 565 is an online tool that can be accessed from the following link: [^1^]. You don't need to install anything on your computer, just open the link in your browser.
 
## Step 2: Select the picture you want to convert
 
On the Image Converter 565 webpage, you will see a section where you can upload your picture. Click on the "Browse" button and select the picture you want to convert from your computer. The supported file formats are .png, .jpg and .gif. The maximum file size is 300KB. You should also make sure that you have resized the image to the correct size before you upload it, as this converter will not do any resizing for you.
 
## Step 3: Select the output format
 
Below the upload section, you will see two options for the output format: .c file or .raw file. Select the one that suits your needs. A .c file is a C source code file that contains an array of pixel values that can be used with UTFT functions like drawBitmap(). A .raw file is a binary file that contains raw pixel data that can be used with UTFT functions like loadBitmap().
 
## Step 4: Click on "Make File" and download the converted file
 
After selecting the output format, click on the "Make File" button and wait for the conversion to finish. You will see a link to download the converted file below the button. Click on the link and save the file to your computer.
 
## Step 5: Use the converted file with UTFT library
 
Now you have a converted image file that can be used with UTFT library. You can copy the file to your Arduino or chipKit sketch folder and include it in your code. For example, if you have a .c file named image.c, you can include it like this:
 `#include "image.c"` 
Then you can use UTFT functions to display the image on your TFT LCD module. For example, if you have a UTFT object named myGLCD, you can display the image like this:
 `myGLCD.drawBitmap(0, 0, 320, 240, image);` 
If you have a .raw file named image.raw, you can use it like this:
 `myGLCD.loadBitmap(0, 0, 320, 240, "image.raw");` 
You can find more information about UTFT library and its functions on its official website: .

## Limitations of using Image Converter 565
 
Image Converter 565 is a useful tool, but it also has some limitations that you should be aware of:

- It has a maximum file size of 300KB, so you may need to compress or resize your images before uploading them.
- It does not do any resizing or cropping of your images, so you need to adjust the dimensions of your images to match your TFT LCD module.
- It does not support animated .gif files, so you cannot use them with this tool.
- It does not have any options to adjust the quality or color depth of your images, so you may need to edit them before or after conversion.
